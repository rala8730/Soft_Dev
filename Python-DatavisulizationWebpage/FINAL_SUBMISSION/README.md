DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

1.Download the source code from the GitHub link above: pollutiondata.sql and cgi-bin, which includes the .py files to run the website  
2.Start a local CGI server from the directory where the .sql was downloaded.  
3.Initialize a database using the pollutiondata.sql file.  Edit all four main.py files to your mysql user, password, and database name.  It is inconvenient but we didnâ€™t have time to find another solution to this  
4.Open a browser and navigate to main.py
